# LFE (LoveForEveryone)

In this folder I publish my own fabrications in terms of music, which as of now is limited to texts. Those products are not meant to be of high quality.
Everything thats published under Github.com/FreshPopcorn42/75Mhz/Music/LFE (LoveForEveryone) can be used by anyone to create any art as long as it is following these guidelines:

1. I can publish everything thats based on this content on any platform in the name of the project (75Mhz/LFE)
2. When publishing this stuff, I keep the money I potentially earned, in the name of the project and use it to further push my open source projects
3. You are specifically allowed to publish your art yourself too, no partie is required to give the other one credits
4. The piece of art does not breake the law, especially not swiss law, since this is from where I will publish it
5. Using this content, you are obbligated to share your content emediatley and in high quality with me via 75Mhz@protonmail.com and accept the rules specified in this list
6. These terms can change at any time, which does not affect artwork that is already published by 75Mhz/LFE
